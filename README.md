## Overview
This is a custom PCB design featuring:

- **Microcontroller Circuit** with supporting components
- **LED Indicator (D1)** for output signaling
- **Resistor (R1)** for current limiting
- **Input/Output Connectors (J1, J2, J3, J4)** for easy interfacing
- **IC Components (U1 and main IC)** for circuit functionality

The board was designed to optimize **compactness**, **easy connectivity**, and **reliability**.
